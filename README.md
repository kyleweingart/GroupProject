#### Description

Have you ever visited a city and wished you had the local knowledge and know how to experience the very best the city had to offer?   Rich Pix is a gateway to do just that.  Initially as a proof of concept the app will be focused on places in Richmond, Virginia that have amazing views.  The goal is to have users submit photos of scenic photos taken on their smart phone and making it possible for other users to see the location of those photos so they will have a map of all the scenic areas in RVA.  But this is just the start- ultimately we want users to be able to choose from a list of categories including nightlife, food, outdoor activities, scenic views, etc. and then be able to both submit their own experiences to the map and search the submission of other users. 

#### Use Cases 

Someone wants to find a place to watch the sunset within a certain radius of where they are. 

Someone wants to search for places where lots of people have submitted photos as these places must be good places to visit. 

Someone sees a pothole and submits photo to the app which then gets alerted to City of Richmond

Someone wants to find places with excellent hummus - they can search the user submissions for places with hummus. 

Someone wants to find awesome places to spend a Saturday on the James River- they can use the app to see where others have submitted points and search for what they were doing. 

Someone really loves sunning on a particular rock on the James River. They can log it in the app and share so others can also check out the rock. 

Someone is looking for good fishing spots.  They can log in to the app and see where others have gone fishing on the James River and see comments pictures of fish caught. 



#### Sketch of Final Project

Mapping interface that the user has the ability to drop a pin on and add a photo and log the time of day, month, year the photo was taken.  Eventually we would like users to search pins within certain radius of where they are located.
